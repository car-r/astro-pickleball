## Best Budget Pickleball Paddle

The best budget pickleball paddle is the SLK Evo Hybrid Max. We consider budget paddles to be anything under $100, although there are times when a great paddle above $100 is a good deal. With that being said, budget paddles are geared more towards beginners and intermediate players who are looking to upgrade from a paddle that comes in a set. This paddle would be a step up from your entry level paddle that comes included in a kit from your local sporting good store.

The SLK Evo Hybrid Max is a step up from your entry level paddle from Selkirk and other pickleball brands. This paddle offers a large sweet spot thanks to the Flex Power fiberglass face which makes it extremely forgiving. The weight is also on the lighter side coming in between 7.6-8oz which can allow for quicker hands at the net. 

## Best Pickleball Paddle for Beginners

The best pickleball paddle for beginners is the HEAD Radical Elite. If you're not buying paddles in a set, this is a great option for a beginner. The weight comes in at 8.1oz making it easy to control and the Ergo Grip foam handle offers added comfort and better feel.

The Composite Hitting Surface (CHS) from HEAD provides a larger sweet spot and a 15mm thick honeycomb core that offers a blend of power and playability. The CHS has a softer feel than entry level paddles which makes touch shots and dinks easier to manage. The Radical Elite is a great paddle that should last a long time as you improve your game!

## Best Pickleball Paddle for Intermediate Players

If you live in Florida or Arizona, many of the pickleball players are retired. This has a lot to do with the percentage of retired people who live in both Arizona and Florida, but they really do enjoy the game! Pickleball is a low impact outdoor activity that is easy to learn and a great way to make friends. Many people you run into on the courts wtill tell you that pickleball is the most exercise they've gotten in years or even decades.

## Best Pickleball Paddle for Experienced Players

Pickleball might be the easiest sport to get started as a beginner, but you can also improve quickly. Going from a beginner to an intermediate can take months instead of years, especially if you spend enough time on the court. Your technique isn't necessarily limited by your athletic ability. While being more athletic than average doesn't hurt, more practice can overcome athletic ability.

Being a smarter player than your opponent can also help you improve quickly. If you have the patience to keep the ball in play and keep your unforced errors to a minimum you can win more matches. You can apply those same lessons to pickleball strategy. Hitting high percentage shots, playing balls down the middle, and having a strong consistent serve can make you great player.
