It's no surprise that pickleball is one of the fastest growing sports in America. Any age group can pick up a paddle and the learning curve is relatively low. You don't need to be in shape or a great athlete to fun on the court. This post will go over why pickleball is exploding in popularity.

## Easy to learn

Pickleball is easy to learn. The hand-eye coordination is easier to pick up than tennis because the pace of place is much slower. While the professionals are certainly banging the ball around, your average player isn't hitting a ball you can't get to. There is plenty of time to move your feet to the ball and get your paddle on it.

Serving doesn't require hours of private lessons just to hit it over the net. Anyone can learn to hit the underhand serve after a little bit of practice. The hard part is getting used to how light the ball is and how hard you need to hit it to get it over the net.

## Pickleball has less injuries

Compared to tennis, you're less likely to get injured playing pickleball. A lot of recreational tennis players have experienced tennis elbow. Tennis elbow typically comes from paying too much and squeezing the racquet to tight. Pickleball paddles are much lighter and you rarely hit the ball as hard as you can.

Shoulder injuries are common for tennis players and baseball players because of all of the throwing and serving. Pickleball also doesn't require as many overhead movements. Everyone loves hitting a hard overhead smash at the net, but pickleball players try very hard to keep the ball low and below shoulder height.

Rolling your ankle isn't a high risk injury in pickleball because the court is so much smaller. You don't have to go on a full sprint to get to a ball and side to side movement is less strenuous. You can still have a bad sprain playing pickleball, but the game is more about patience than athleticism.

## Pickleball is fun for all ages

If you live in Florida or Arizona, many of the pickleball players are retired. This has a lot to do with the percentage of retired people who live in both Arizona and Florida, but they really do enjoy the game! Pickleball is a low impact outdoor activity that is easy to learn and a great way to make friends. Many people you run into on the courts wtill tell you that pickleball is the most exercise they've gotten in years or even decades.

## Easy to improve

Pickleball might be the easiest sport to get started as a beginner, but you can also improve quickly. Going from a beginner to an intermediate can take months instead of years, especially if you spend enough time on the court. Your technique isn't necessarily limited by your athletic ability. While being more athletic than average doesn't hurt, more practice can overcome athletic ability.

Being a smarter player than your opponent can also help you improve quickly. If you have the patience to keep the ball in play and keep your unforced errors to a minimum you can win more matches. You can apply those same lessons to pickleball strategy. Hitting high percentage shots, playing balls down the middle, and having a strong consistent serve can make you great player.

## Okay, keeping score is complicated

While pickleball is easy to pick up, there is definitely a learning curve when it comes to keeping track of the score. 5-7-2... what does that even mean? The first number refers to the serving team's score, the second number is the returning teams score, and the thrid number keeps track of which team member is serving.
