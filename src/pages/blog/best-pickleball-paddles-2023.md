## Best Budget Pickleball Paddle
### Selkirk SLK Evo Hybrid Max
[![Selkirk SLK Evo Hybrid Max](/images/selkirk-evo-hybrid-max.jpg)](https://slkpickleball.com/products/slk-evo-hybrid-max)

The best budget pickleball paddle is the SLK Evo Hybrid Max. We consider budget paddles to be anything under $100, although there are times when a great paddle above $100 is a good deal. With that being said, budget paddles are geared more towards beginners and intermediate players who are looking to upgrade from a paddle that comes in a set. This paddle would be a step up from your entry level paddle that comes included in a kit from your local sporting good store.

The SLK Evo Hybrid Max is a step up from your entry level paddle from Selkirk and other pickleball brands. This paddle offers a large sweet spot thanks to the Flex Power fiberglass face which makes it extremely forgiving. The weight is also on the lighter side coming in between 7.6-8oz which can allow for quicker hands at the net. 

One of the biggest benefits to this paddle is the elongated handle. The grip length measures in at 4.85 inches, making it very comfortable to hit groundstrokes with. Players can get more leverage on a topspin forehand since they can extend their index finger without putting it on the backside of the paddle. The grip also has plenty of room fit both hands on the grip for a two handed backhand.

The JOOLA Vision CGS 16 is our pick for the best overall pickleball paddle. JOOLA is a trusted name in the pickleball space and is used by some of the top players in the sport. The JOOLA Vision CGS 16 is an excellent blend of price and performance which brings it to the top of the overall list.

The Vision CGS 16 features an Aero-Curve design for less drag through the air to help increase overall swing speed. It also features an edge guard which is different from the edgeless design that is becoming popular with other paddles. The Carbon Grip Surface (CGS) helps players get additional spin for topspin and slice shots. Some reviewers have said that the grip surfact on the paddle only lasts a few months, but this will be different for each player.

Average paddle weight comes in at a light 7.8oz, which makes for great maneuverability at the net. The Response Honeycomb Polymer Core provides a large sweetspot and feedback while the 16mm thickness helps with touch and control. The price of the paddle is currently under $200 which also makes it a relatively budget friendly paddle.

The SuperCore Polymer Honeycomb Core offers a consistent feel during play.

The best pickleball paddle for intermediate players is the Selkirk SLK Halo XL Power. We picked the this paddle because it offers a blend of power and control at reasonable price. Intermediate players would benefit from the elongated handle to produce heavy topspin on both the forhand and backhand side. The grip length of 5.75 inches is plenty of room to fit both hands on the paddle for a nice two handed backhand. We found that the power version didn't have that much more power than the control and might be better for an intermediate player.

Max and XL versions of the SLK Halo are available depending upon your needs. The Max features a larger paddle shape and increase sweetspot while the XL has an elongated shape and a longer handle. The paddle is 13mm thick and features T700 carbon fiber with Raw Spin Technology to provide additional control and spin. Weights range from 7.6 - 8.2oz with a maximum length of 16.4 inches for the XL version. 

There is also a Control version of this paddle which is slightly thicker and also comes in an XL version.
