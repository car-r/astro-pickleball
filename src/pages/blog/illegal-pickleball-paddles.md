Did you know that certain pickleball paddles are deemed illegal for competitive play? Just like professional baseball banning metal bats, the world of pickleball has its own set of regulations to ensure fair and safe gameplay. Some paddles are build in such a way that they can provide a competitive advantage. In this blog post, we’ll go over what makes a pickleball paddle illegal and where you can find a list of approved paddles. Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of pickleball paddle legality!

## Illegal Pickleball Paddles

An illegal pickleball paddle is one that does not meet the paddle specification outlined by USA Pickleball. USA Pickleball has an equipment standards document that provides all of the various specifications needed for paddles, balls, and nets to remain in compliance.

It’s important to use approved paddles and equipment for a few reasons.

- Disqualification from tournaments can occur if you use an illegal pickleball paddle.
- Using approved paddles ensures fair matches and gameplay.
- Safety issues may arise from the use of non-approved equipment.
- By using approved paddles, you can save costs and avoid the hassle of purchasing new equipment.

The major issue with using an illegal pickleball paddle is being disqualified from a tournament. There have been instances of disqualification due to the use of a <a href="/blog/is-my-pickleball-paddle-delaminated">delaminated pickleball paddle</a>. This was controversial because a player can unknowingly use a delaminated paddle that gives them an advantage. <a href="/blog/how-long-do-pickleball-paddles-last">Pickleball paddles</a> don't last forever, and over time they can break down and become delaminated. To address this issue, paddle companies have worked with the manufacturers to improve quality control.

It’s important that players use approved paddles to keep matches fair and maintain the integrity of the sport. Using illegal paddles that provide an unfair advantage without strict enforcement in tournaments could potentially hinder participation and growth in the sport. Additionally, prominent pickleball professionals speaking out against illegal paddle usage can bring negative attention to the sport and paddle companies. 

Safety issues may arise when using paddles or equipment that aren’t approved for competitive use. Certain manufacturing defects in paddles could can cause them to unexpectedly break, potentially resulting in injuries. Overly powerful paddles may also increase pickleball speed to a point that it can be dangerous for players at the net. While this is unlikely, you’re better off using approved equipment just to be on the safe side.

There is also a potential cost and time savings to using approved paddles. If the paddle you’re using becomes illegal, you’ll need to buy a different model and take the time to get used to it. If a new paddle on the market is generating a lot of hype because of it’s god-like performance, it might be worth waiting to see if the paddle gets banned before making the switch. Reputable paddle companies have reimbursed customers if their paddle has gotten banned, but it’s still headache to deal with.

## Types of Illegal Pickleball Paddles

Pickleball paddles are considered illegal if they break one of three main criteria:

1. Paddle size and dimensions
2. Surface violations (delamination, holes, etc) 
3. Paddle alterations or modifications

### Pickleball Paddle size and dimensions

Paddle size and dimension violations are fairly easy to spot and test for. The rules are also very clear on the acceptable dimensions.

- 2.E.3. The combined length and width, including any edge guard and butt cap, shall not exceed 24 inches (60.96 cm). The paddle length cannot exceed 17 inches (43.18 cm). There is no restriction on paddle thickness.

### Illegal Pickleball Paddle Surfaces

Surface violations have been the most controversial type of illegal pickleball paddle. There were complaints from professional players suggesting that other competitors were using delaminated pickleball paddles. Since then, paddle manufacturers have been working on addressing these quality control issues.

- 2.E.2. The paddle’s hitting surface shall not contain delamination, holes, cracks or indentations that break the paddle skin or surface.

Paddles are also not allowed to have holes in the face or surface. One such paddle that does have this is the Diadem Vice. Retailers do note that this paddle is not approved for tournament use. If you’re considering playing tournaments or don’t want to get dirty looks at the local courts, its best to avoid this paddle or any paddle with holes in it.

### Illegal Pickleball Paddle Modifications

The most common types of illegal pickleball paddle modifications involve the surface of the paddle. USA Pickleball rule section 2.E.6. does not allow for the following paddle surface modifications:

- Anti-skid paint or any paint textured with sand, rubber particles, or any material that causes additional spin.
- Rubber and synthetic rubber.
- Sandpaper characteristics.
- Moving parts that can increase head momentum.
- No removable parts except for paddle grip adjustments and/or grip wraps and lead tape on the paddle edge

### Legal Pickleball Paddle Modifications

Players are allowed to modify or alter their paddle as long as the paddle still meets the required specifications. Legal modifications include:

1. Using Edge guards or edge tape
2. Adding lead tape to adjust balance and paddle weight
3. Increasing or decreasing the grip size
4. Using a different or additional grip

One of the most popular ways to customize your pickleball paddle is to add lead tape to the edges. This can give the paddle a different swing weight and help make the paddle feel more balanced. Doing this is completely legal and acceptable in tournament play.

It is also fairly common to adjust the grip size on your pickleball paddle. Paddles tend to come in one grip size per paddle. Players with larger hands might need to build up the grip by using build up sleeves or adding an overgrip. Changing out your overgrip after matches or tournaments is recommended as they do wear out over time and can impact performance.

## Approved Pickleball Paddles

The best way to make sure you’re using a legal paddle is to double check the list of <a href="https://equipment.usapickleball.org/paddle-list/">approved pickleball paddles</a> from USA Pickleball. You can search all makes and models and there are over 2,000 paddles on the list. The list is updated frequently so be sure to check back if a new paddle comes out that you’re interested in purchasing.

It’s also helpful to stay informed about any rule changes if you play in any leagues or tournaments. There are times when certain equipment becomes illegal a few months after launch. You can also check with your local pickleball store or tennis shop.

## Conclusion

Using illegal paddles either knowingly or unknowingly for very casual use probably isn’t the end of the world. If you are playing locally at public courts or in tournaments, its crucial to make sure you’re using an approved paddle. The last thing you want is to be known as the person using an illegal paddle at the local courts. 

The easiest way to stay compliant with the rules is to double check the list of approved paddles from USA Pickleball. You can also check with your local pickleball store or tennis shop as paddles can be added or removed from the approved list. It’s also not a bad idea to swap out your paddle for a new one if you’re playing pickleball often. While they are durable, pickleball paddles can wear out over time. If you’re going to modify your paddle, keep it limited to lead tape and grip changes.
