Did you hear someone mention their DUPR rating and have no idea what they’re talking about? In this guide, we'll tell you everything you need to know about DUPR ratings and how they’re different from self-rating and other <a href="/blog/pickleball-ratings">pickleball rating</a> systems. 

## What is a DUPR Rating?

A DUPR Rating is an algorithmic rating system for pickleball players. It provides pickleball players with a score between 2.0 and 8.0 to determine their skill level. It’s supposed to be more accurate than self-rating and UPTR ratings because it includes more data points to measure from. 

DUPR ratings take all of your matches into account regardless of where they happened. Recreational games with friends can be added to your rating as long as all the players agree. Official tournaments will post their scores and those will be added to your rating.

## How do I get a DUPR Rating

The only way to get a DUPR rating is to play DUPR matches. You can find local players right from within the app. All official tournament matches factor into your score. Recreational DUPR matches can be added right into the mobile app. 

A DUPR rating will generate after you enter your very first game. After you’ve played a few games and entered them into the app, the app will develop a more accurate rating. If you’ve played tournaments before downloading the app, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.support.mydupr.com/" target="_blank">claim your profile</a> with DUPR to get your rating. 


## How accurate is DUPR

DUPR ratings are very accurate. Pulling in match data from multiple sources, including recreational play and leagues, provides more data to work with. It also increases the size of the player pool analyze.

There are great pickleball players who don’t play tournaments. These players matches can be factored into the DUPR rating system and help others better gauge their level.

## How does DUPR work

The DUPR rating system works by applying 3 factors.

1. Wins and losses
2. Type of match
3. The rating of your opponent

Wins and losses are an obvious metric to track when coming up with a rating system. If a 3.0 player beats a 3.5, the 3.0 player will have a slight increase in their ranking and the 3.5 will have a slight decrease.

DUPR ratings include the type of match into their rating system. Recreational matches are worth half as much as official tournament matches. A recreational match win is worth 0.05 points whereas a tournament match is worth 0.1 points.

You’ll still have the opportunity to accumulate a decent amount of points if you play a lot of recreational DUPR matches. Recreational matches are worth less because the playing environment is less challenging than tournament play. These matches are more casual and supposed to be fun for everyone.

The last factor in the DUPR rating is the rating of your opponent. Getting a big win against a better opponent can be worth more than beating someone at a similar or lower level. Beating players that aren’t as good as you are is great way to sandbag your rating and keep it lower than it should be. 

### How do I get people to use DUPR
