Pickleball growth in the last few years is having a positive impact on the overall health 
of players across all age groups. Baby boomers and older have found a new reason to get 
outside and exercise! Not only is it a fun and exciting sport to play, 
it also provides numerous health benefits and some you may not have expected!

## Brain Health and Longevity

Alzheimers continues to impact older generations, with more than 6 million Americans
<a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures#:~:text=More%20than%206%20million%20Americans%20of%20all%20ages%20have%20Alzheimer's,older%20(10.7%25)%20has%20Alzheimer's">impacted</a> today. 
This number is expected to increase to 13 million by 2050. 
Exercising your brain has never been more important if you want to live a long and healthy life.

Dr. Amen was recently interviewed by Shawn Stevenson on the Model Health Show and explained 
why he encourages racquet sports for overall health and wellness and to rehabilitate the brain.

> People that play racquet sports live longer than everybody else.

Dr. Amen goes on to explain how the cerebellum has 10% of the brains volume, 
but more than half of the brain’s neurons. The reason this is important is because 
one of its main functions is not only physical coordination, 
but thought coordination and how quickly you can process information. 
Not only are your cerebellum and parietal lobes getting a workout, 
but your frontal lobes are as well! Your frontal lobes are helping you create and develop 
your strategy during the game and your parietal lobes are helping you watch and 
judge the ball as its moving through space.

## Weight Loss

Losing weight is top of mind for many people, especially in the United States. 
Over 40% of American adults are suffering from <a href="https://www.tfah.org/report-details/state-of-obesity-2022/#:~:text=Nationally%2C 41.9 percent of adults,obesity rate of 45.6 percent.">obesity</a>, 
a number that has grown in past few decades. 
Every year new weight loss drugs and fad diets come onto the scene, 
but sometimes good old fashioned exercise is the best medicine! 

Pickleball has become a central part of a weight loss journey for many people who have picked up 
the sport. It isn’t uncommon to hear about a friend of a friend who started playing pickleball 
and has dramatically altered their physical appearance! 

Playing pickleball is a fun way to lose weight. It is a lot more interesting than 
spending time on a treadmill or going to the gym, and the game puts a smile on your face! 
The sport requires a lot of low-impact physical activity, which can burn a significant number of calories. 
A 150-pound person can burn nearly 300 calories in just 30 minutes of pickleball. 
Playing pickleball regularly can help you maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of obesity.

## Cardiovascular Health

Cardiovasuclar health is another concern for adults. Over 600,000 people die every year from 
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm">cardiovascular disease</a> in the United States,
 which is roughly 1 in 5 deaths. Obesity and physical inactivity are two contributing factors to heart disease, 
 and pickleball can be a great lifestyle choice to help you get back on track!

Pickleball can help you improve your cardiovascular health since it gets you physically 
active and spending time outside. The sport involves a lot of movement, which gets your heart 
rate up and improves blood circulation. Regular pickleball sessions may be helpful to lower 
your blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and improve overall cardiovascular health.

## Improved Balance and Coordination

Pickleball and racquet sports in general are a great way to improve your balance and coordination. 
Changing direction on the court requires players to be balanced and maintain a strong center 
of gravity. The sport also involves a lot of hand-eye coordination, 
which can help improve your reaction time.

One of the interesting things about pickleball is that players don’t need to be very athletic 
in order to play or be competitive. New players will see tremendous improvement in their balance 
and coordination after spending time having fun on the pickleball court. 
Being able to quickly move to the ball and actually make contact with the 
paddle can be a big accomplishment for those who didn’t grow up playing sports.

Improving hand-eye coordination is also another benefit of pickleball. 
Psychological Science published <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/study-links-childrens-eye-hand-coordination-with-their-academic-performance.html">research</a> 
in 2018 that linked better hand-eye coordination to higher academic performance. 
The students with better hand-eye coordination scored higher on reading, writing, 
and mathematics when compared to national averages. 
We’re not saying that playing pickleball will make you smarter, but picking up a paddle can’t hurt!

## Increased Strength and Endurance

Playing pickleball might not be as physically demanding as playing basketball or football, 
but playing consistently can increase your strength and endurance. 
The sport involves a lot of changing directions, lunging, and swinging, which 
can help build muscle mass and increase overall strength. 
You’re going to use muscles you probably haven’t used in awhile, and thats a good thing!

Regular pickleball sessions can also help you improve endurance. The first few times you play 
you might be out of gas after 30 minutes. After a few weeks or months of playing consistently 
you might be able to last 60 to 90 minutes. A quick stop at the local pickleball courts 
and you’ll see the same people playing for hours each day because they’re having so much fun.

## Socialization and Mental Health

Pickleball is also a very social sport that can help improve mental health. 
Most players are very friendly and many are new to the game as well. 
Pickleball is unique compared to other sports because pickup games are very common. 
Going to the local courts to play provides opportunities to meet new people and make friends, 
which can help reduce social isolation and improve overall well-being. 

Exercise has been <a href="https://www.ihrsa.org/improve-your-club/new-report-exercise-plays-key-role-in-mental-health-well-being/">linked</a> 
to improving mental health and often leads to positive outcomes. 
Taking action and actually starting an exercise routine is much easier said than done. 
Many people find it easier to take an exercise class or pickup a new hobby rather 
than exercise on their own. Playing a sport like pickleball is a great way to combine 
exercise with having fun and making new memories!

## Conclusion

We might be biased, but playing pickleball can be a great benefit to your overall health. 
Some of those benefits include improved brain health and longevity, cardiovascular health, 
weight loss, improved balance and coordination, increased strength and endurance, and 
socialization and mental health. So, grab a paddle and join in on the fun!
