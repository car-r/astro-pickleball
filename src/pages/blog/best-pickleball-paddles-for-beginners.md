The Selkirk Evo Hybrid is a favorite pickleball paddle for beginners. You’ll find this to be a popular paddle being used at your local pickleball courts and for good reason. It is priced right, features a polymer rev core and is USAPA approved for tournament play.

Selkirk is a very well known brand in pickleball, and their SLK line of paddles is geared towards budget friendly buyers. With that being said, budget friendly does not mean low quality. The SLK Evo Hybrid has a large sweet spot thanks to the Polymer Rev Core and the C6-Flex Power Fiberglass face give you all the power and control that you need.

Paddle weight is between 7.6oz to 8oz which is light enough for any beginner to use and makes for quick hands at the net. The grip length is 5.25 inches which is great for players who either already have or want to have a two-handed backhand. The extra reach is also a great nice to have for players of all skill levels.

If you’re looking for the best overall paddle for beginners that won’t break the bank, the SLK Evo Hybrid should definitely be on your list!

## Head Radical Elite
The best budget friendly pickleball paddle for beginners is the HEAD Radical Elite. Head has been providing top notch tennis equipment for decades and has made their way into the wild world of pickleball. The <a href="https://www.head.com/en_US/radical-elite-226032.html" target="_blank">Head Radical Elite</a> is an excellent budget friendly pickleball paddle that is targeted to beginners. It is a well rounded paddle that won't empty your pockets.

Head's Composite Hitting Surface (CHS) with an Extended Powercore provides max power as well as a soft feel to add finese to your game. The large sweetspot is forgiving enough for beginners due to the Dynamic Power Shape. The Ergo Grip has a foam filled handle providing comfort and feel while on the court. The paddle weighs in at around 8.1 oz and is 16 inches long. This weight is the perfect balance of lightness and stability.

## Selkirk Latitude Pickleball Paddle

Selkirk is a well known pickleball brand, and the Latitude Pickleball bundle is a great way to get started. The bundle includes two paddles and three balls and can be had for around $100. This is a great and inexpensive way for a couple or family to start playing. Your local Costco or sporting good store should have these in stock.

The Selkirk Latitude is self-described as a great all-around paddle with a large sweet spot and should be plenty for a recreational player and last a long time. It is a graphite paddle with a polymer core and weighs between 6.9 and 7.9oz. The comfort grip measures 5.25" in length and 4.25" in circumference. The grip length may be a little short for more advanced players or for someone who hits a two handed backhand, but a recreational player won't notice the difference.

If you're looking to buy a bundle set with everything you and a partner need to get started playing pickleball, the Selkirk Latitude is a no brainer!

## ONIX Graphite Z5

The ONIX Graphite Z5 Pickleball paddle is a highly reviewed and recommended paddle that is geared towards beginners. ONIX claims it is their most popular paddle in terms of volume sales. It is half as expensive as the higher end paddles, is packed full of features, and comes from a long standing brand in the Pickleball industry.

The ONOX Graphite Z5 features a nomex core and graphite face that provides great feel for the ball for dinks and resets. Weighing in between 7.5oz and 8.2oz, it is light enough for great maneuverability near the kitchen but also produces the power when you need it. Grip length is 4.25 inches long and the paddle width is 8.125 inches that provides a large and forgiving sweet spot.

If you’re looking for a paddle that is a top seller with a large amount of reviews and is available in any color you could imagine, the ONIX Graphite Z5 is a great choice!

## Selkirk SLK Halo Control XL

The SLK Halo Pickleball paddles always manage to make an appearance on different <a href="/blog/best-pickleball-paddles-2023">best pickleball paddle</a> lists, and for good reason. It is reasonably priced, available in different configurations, produces good spin and is very durable.

We love the Selkirk SLK Halo Control XL for beginners because it is a paddle you can grow into. The paddle will feel softer than your typical beginner paddle, but after a few games you’ll get used to the extra touch and feel the paddle provides. As your game starts to improve, you’ll also figure out that you can hit the ball harder and with more spin while keeping the ball in the court.

The SLK Halo Control XL weighs in between 7.6oz and 8.2oz, making it light enough for beginners but also sturdy enough for more advanced players. New players won’t struggle with the weight. The paddle is also 16.4 inches long with a 5.75 inch grip length, perfect for those looking to learn a two handed backhand and long enough to help with hard to reach shots.

We recommend the Halo Control XL over the Halo Power XL because beginners don’t need the extra power. Having too much power early on in your pickleball journey can make the game too frustrating if you’re hitting balls out. You need to build your confidence and consistency first. You can always graduate to the Halo Power XL if you feel your game needs the extra pop.

If you’re willing to spend a little bit more on a paddle as a beginner, the SLK Halo might be the right choice for you! You can read our full <a href="/blog/selkirk-slk-halo-control-xl-review">Selkirk SLK Halo Control XL Review</a> for more information on one of our favorite paddles!

## Conclusion

As we said before, the best pickleball paddle for beginners is the one that you'll use the most. The equipment doesn't make the player, and you're better off spending more
time on the court improving your game. With that being said, having the wrong equipment
can make the game more frustrating than it needs to be! 

We wouldn't hesitate to recommend any of the paddles on this list, so find the one that makes the most sense to you. You also shouldn't hesitate to jump right into a high end paddle if you plan on playing often and it fits within your budget.
