## What is an Erne in Pickleball

The Erne is an advanced pickleball shot where you volley the ball close to the net while stepping or jumping over the kitchen. The shot was named after Erne Perry who popularized it in 2010 during nationals. 

The team he was playing against liked to hit the ball straight across the net during net battles, giving Perry the opportunity to pull off the Erne multiple times during the match. It was such an effective shot because it took their opponents by surprise and is difficult to defend against.

Hitting an Erne is a legal way to hit a volley as close to the net as possible without violating <a href="/blog/pickleball-rules">pickleball rules</a>. It is a poaching strategy that is used in both <a href="/blog/pickleball-vs-tennis">pickleball and tennis</a>. It does take some athleticism to pull off this shot since it is typically hit in midair and the timing of the jump is critical. 

## How to Hit an Erne Pickleball Shot

![How to hit the erne shot in pickleball](/images/hit-the-erne.jpg)

Hitting an Erne can be done in four simple steps.

1. Identify the Right Moment for the Erne Shot
2. Jump or step around the kitchen
3. Hit the volley in midair
4. Land outside the sideline without going into the kitchen

The Erne shot can be done from either side of the court. It is easier to learn the timing of an Erne when hitting a forehand, but make it a point to practice on the backhand side as well.

Let’s start with an example of a right handed player standing on the left side of the court at the kitchen line. 

### Identify The Right Moment For the Erne Shot

![How to identify the right moment to hit the erne shot in pickleball](/images/recognize-the-erne.jpg)

The first step in hitting a successful Erne is recognizing the opportunity. There are common pickleball shot patterns to recognize while anticipating to go for an Erne. Once your “Erne alarm” turns on and you’re anticipating an easy shot from your opponent, you’re ready to start timing your shot.

Timing is important when you’re hitting an Erne. You don’t want to make it to obvious to your opponent what you’re going to do. If you jump for the Erne too soon, your opponent might see that in the corner of their eye and try to keep the ball crosscourt and away from you. 

Making your move at the last second helps defend against this and make the Erne more effective. You should wait until just before your opponent makes contact with the ball before attacking. 

### Jump or Step Around the Kitchen

After recognizing the perfect opportunity to hit an Erne, it’s time to jump over the kitchen and land outside the sideline. There is no right way to jump over the kitchen, but you will have a favorite leg to jump off of. Figure out which leg that is and make sure to push off with that leg. 

Taking the example of a right handed player on the left side of the kitchen, they might be most comfortable jumping off of the right foot and landing on the left foot. 

### Hitting the Ball in Midair

After making your jump it’s time to hit the ball in midair. You can be standing outside the sideline when you hit the ball, but it happens so fast you’ll probably be in midair on contact. 

You should be planning on finishing the point if you’re hitting an Erne. You’re taking yourself out of position when you go for this shot, and you should be close enough to the net to finish the point. Aim for the open court if you can, or attack the feet of the player in front of you if you can’t. 

Some players do have unbelievable hands and will be able to get the ball back. Your partner should be ready to cover you if you decide to go for the Erne. 

### Landing Outside the Sideline

Momentum rules still apply when hitting an Erne. You can’t fall back into the kitchen after hitting the shot. Make sure you land and are firmly in control of your momentum before stepping back into the kitchen. 

## When to Hit an Erne in Pickleball

The secret to hitting an Erne in pickleball is waiting for the right moment. You must be patient enough to work the point at the net and create the opportunity. Let’s go over the best ways to recognize when it’s time to hit an Erne:

1. Your opponent is being pulled to the sideline
2. Your opponent is off balance
3. Your opponent likes to dink down the line instead of crosscourt

There is a natural instinct when it comes time to hit an Erne. After spending enough time on the court, you can start to recognize the signs of when your opponent is going to give you an easy ball to attack with an Erne.

### Pulling Your Opponent to the Sideline

During a net battle, you’ll have a chance to pull your opponents away from the center of the court. One way to do this is with a two shot pattern. The first shot will bring them closer to the center line and away from the middle of the their side of the court. The second shot should then pull them to the sideline where they need to move their feet. If possible, this shot should be kept low and be unexpected by your opponent.

### Your Opponent is Off Balance

One of the best times to go for an Erne is when your opponent is off balance. This happens when your opponent is in a deep stretch for the ball or learning back to hit the shot. When your opponent is off balance they’re less likely to hit a great crosscourt shot.

When you recognize that your opponent is off balance, you can anticipate an easy shot that you can attack. Learn which side is your opponents weaker side and hit there to make them uncomfortable. Your opponent may also favor one side or the other, leaving space on the court to push them in the opposite direction.

### Your Opponent Dinks Down the Line

The majority of dinks will be hit crosscourt or towards the middle. There are times when changing direction and hitting a dink down the line makes sense. If you notice that one of your opponents likes to dink down the line, or straight ahead, you can take advantage of this.

Just like noticing when your opponent is off balance, you will begin to anticipate when they’re most likely to push the ball down the line. When the opportunity comes, hold on until the last second and then attack with an Erne. Worst case scenario they will hit the ball crosscourt in which case your partner should be covering you.

## Forehand Erne and Backhand Erne

You can hit an Erne shot in pickleball with either the forehand or the backhand side. Forehands will feel more comfortable at the beginning and we recommend practicing those first. Depending upon which side you play or your <a href="/blog/pickleball-stacking">stacking strategy</a>, you'll quickly need to learn how to hit a backhand Erne as well!

The most common way to hit a forehand Erne is to be on the side where your forehand is in the middle. In other words, right handed players should hit a forehand Erne from the left side of the court, and left handed players should hit a forehand Erne from the right side of the court.

The opposite is true for the backhand side. Right handed players should go for a backhand Erne from the right side of the court, and left handed players will hit a backhand Erne from the left side of the court. 

Why should you practice hitting Erne's this way? Because you should play on hitting your Erne shot down the line and at the feet of your opponent. It is easier to hit a right handed forehand Erne down the line from the left side of the court as an example. 

This isn't to say that you can't hit a right handed forehand Erne from the right side of the court. Every point and situation is different. You're just less likely to hit a strong shot down the line otherwise.

Be sure to practice both the forehand and backhand Erne with your partner and get comfortable recognizing when to attack.
