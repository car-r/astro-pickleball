Pickleball is a fun, fast-paced game that can be played by people of all ages. It's a cross between tennis, badminton, and ping pong, and can be enjoyed by anyone who loves sports. It's an enjoyable way to get a <a href="/blog/the-health-benefits-of-playing-pickleball">stay healthy</a> and make new friends. Here's everything you need to know about pickleball, including how to play it and where you can find courts near you.

To play pickleball, players use a solid paddle and a plastic ball with holes similar to a wiffle ball. The game is played on a badminton-sized court that is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide. Points are only are scored when you or your team is serving, and most points are won by being the first team to get close to the net. Games are typically played to 11 points, and there are singles or doubles variations.

You don't need much to get started. All you need is a court (which can often be found at local parks or community centers) and some equipment. Many cities even offer beginner lessons or pickup games for those interested in trying out pickleball. And for more competitive players, there are tournaments held all over the country at different skill levels.

## Pickleball History

### When Was Pickleball Invented

Pickleball was invented by chance in 1965 on Bainbridge Island in Washington State. Congressman Joel Pritchard was with his friend Bill Bell and their families at Pritchard's home trying to find an activity for the entire family. Pritchard had an old badminton court court on the property but was missing a full set of equipment.

The two of them found ping pong paddles and a plastic ball to volley the ball over the net which was still at badminton height. Over the weekend they realized the asphalt had a decent bounce with the plastic ball and they lowered the net similar to a tennis court. They came up with a set of pickleball rules, borrowing many from badminton, and the rest is history.

A more detailed history of pickleball can be found <a href="https://usapickleball.org/what-is-pickleball/history-of-the-game/">here</a> at the USA Pickleball website.

## How Big is a Pickleball Court?

A pickleball court is 44 feet long and 20 feet wide. It is based on the dimensions of a badminton court since that is what Joel Pritchard had at his home when the game was first invented. For reference, a tennis court is 78 feet long and 36 feet wide.

The non-volley zone, or kitchen, is 7 feet long and 20 feet wide. There is a non-volley zone on each side of the net. Behind the non-volley zone are the service areas. Each service area is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide. The net is 36 inches high at the sidelines and 34 inches at the center, which is the same as tennis.

## Pickleball Today

Today, pickleball is the one of the <a href="/blog/why-is-pickleball-exploding-in-popularity">fastest growing sports</a>. USA Pickleball  membership doubled from passed 30,000 members in 2018 and the Professional Pickleball Registry (PRR) was formed. The PRR is a subsidiary of the Professional Tennis Registry which has been certifying tennis instructures for decades.

Pickleball is now livestreamed on ESPN and other platforms due to rising popularity. Prize money in professional tournaments has increased and some players even have lucrative sponsorship deals. 

Tennis players might be sad to see their old courts converted into multiple pickleball courts, but the growth in the sport can't be denied.

## Singles and Doubles

Pickleball can be played in either singles or doubles format. Doubles is played most often as its easier for beginners and can also be more enjoyable for in a social setting. Two players are on each side similar to doubles in tennis, while singles is played one-on-one. Playing singles is a great way to get extra practice since you get to hit every shot, but you'll definitely be running around more the court.

## Basic Pickleball Rules

Watching pickleball for the first time might scare you away from playing because the rules seem so complicated. The score has three numbers, players are switching sides, you can't stand in certain spots on the court and hit the ball out of the air. Trust us, you're not alone. After playing a few games, you get the hang of the <a href="/blog/pickleball-rules">pickleball rules</a> and feel confident that you know what you're doing.

In doubles, there are three numbers called out for the score. The first number is the serving teams score, the second number is the returning teams score, and the third number refers to which person on the team is serving. The starting score in doubles is 0-0-2, meaning each time has zero points and the second person is serving. In other words, if the serving team loses the point, the other team gets to serve and the score would then be 0-0-1.

The first serve for each time starts on the 'even' side, or the right side if you're facing the net. <a href="/blog/pickleball-serve-rules">Pickleball serving rules</a> guide you on <a href="/blog/how-to-serve-in-pickleball">how to serve</a> and where you can serve. The server must serve over the net to the player diagonal from them and the ball must bounce past the "kitchen" line. After the returning team returns the serve, the serving team must let the ball bounce. This is unique to pickleball and prevents the serving team from serving and volleying.

The "Kitchen", or the Non-Volley Zone is a 7 ft deep box the starts at the net and ends at the service boxes. The Non-Volley Zone is pretty self-explanatory. Players are not allowed to hit the ball out of the air if they're standing inside the kitchen. Players can also not hit the ball out of the air and then step into the kitchen after the shot, essentially "jumping" into the kitchen. Players can, however, jump from behind the kitchen and land outside of the sideline while hitting the ball out of the air. This is a more advanced move, but you will see this from competitive players.

Scoring points can only be done while serving. This is one of the biggest differences between <a href="/blog/pickleball-vs-tennis">pickleball and tennis</a>. From a strategy standpoint, it's important to hold serve and keep serving as long as possible. Players can gain a lot of momentum if they score a few points in a row before the other team gets a chance to serve. The returning team's job is of course to win the point, but more importantly to prevent the serving team from accumulating points and to get back on serve. 

## Pickleball is for all ages

Pickeball has become extremely popular with older folks and retirees. It's cheaper than golf, easier than tennis, and relatively gentle on the body.

The under 40 pickleball crowd is also growing, especially for anyone who used to be an athlete in their younger years. you'll see many of these folks entering local tournaments and playing at a recreational level.

Pickleball is also great for kids. It's easy to learn (except for keeping track of the score!) and less frustrating than golf or tennis. Baseball, lacross, football and soccer are still more popular for kids who are good athletes and want to play a team sport, but that is changing. If school pickleball teams ever come to be, this could cause a lot of growth and a brand new group of players.
