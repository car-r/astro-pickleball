Do you love playing racquet sports? If so, you'll love pickleball! Pickleball is a unique sport that borrows rules from different racquet sports and creates new ones to make the game more competitive. The sport is played with two or four players using paddles, a plastic ball and a net. The basic premise of the game is to hit a ball over a net and make your opponent miss. There are many different shots that can be used in pickleball, making the game interesting for both beginners and experts alike. In this blog post, we will discuss the different rules of pickleball and how you can start playing today!


## Rules Unique to Pickleball

A few pickleball rules will be familiar since many of them are borrowed from other racquet sports. The rules unique to pickleball is what makes it a different and interesting game to play. 

### The Kitchen

The Non-Volley Zone, often referred to as "the kitchen" is the biggest differentiator from other racquet sports. As the name implies, the non-volley zone is a 7 ft area on each side of the net where players can't hit the ball out of the air. It starts at the net and ends at the service boxes, taking up the middle of the court. Players typically stand behind this line so that they ARE allowed to volley the ball out of the air. 

The reason for the kitchen is that it prevents players from running to the net and hitting a hard shot out of the air. It also prevents serving and volleying. A stronger team could dominate the competition if this were allowed. The kitchen allows both teams to hit a defensive shot where the other team will have a hard time hitting a put away.

Players are allowed to stand in the kitchen and hit the ball, but they must let it bounce first. This is why most players stand behind the kitchen until the other team hits a short ball that lands inside of the kitchen. Reaching your paddle into the Non-Volley Zone to hit the ball out of the air before it bounces is allowed, so long as no other part of your body,paddle, or piece of clothing is touching the surface of the kitchen.

Another quirk of the kitchen is that you aren't allowed to hit a ball out of the air while behind the kitchen and then land or have your momentum bring you into the kitchen. You must come to a controlled and complete stop or make a change of direction before moving into the kitchen. More advanced players will work around this by jumping from behind the kitchen, hitting the ball out of the air, and finally landing outside of the sideline. 

### Serving Rules

Serving in pickleball is the opposite as in tennis. In pickleball, players must serve underhand and make contact below their waist. In tennis most serves are hit overhead, although some players will hit an underhand spin serve to try and throw their opponent off of their game. New serving rules have also been added in recent years as more advanced players have developed certain tossing techniques that have given them too much of an advantage.

Players must also stand behind the playing surface and not to the right or left side of either sideline. When serving, the highest point of the paddle may not be higher than the wrist during contact. This is to prevent players from serving with too much topspin. The swing arc must also be in an upward movement from low to high. 

When serving, the ball must also be hit accross the court and not land in the Non-Volley Zone. It is important to note that the Non-Volley Zone line is a part of the Non-Volley Zone, and any serve that hits this line is considered "out". This is somewhat similar to tennis since the ball is serve across the court and must land in a dedicated "service box", with the exception that all lines are considered "in". The ball is allowed to land on the sideline, middle line, or baseline so long as it still lands beyond the kitchen line.

Another interesting rule related to the serve is that both the serve and the return must bounce. In other words, the serving team must let the first shot hit back to them bounce. This rule prevents serving and volleying and allows the points to last longer. This rule is often referred to as the 2-bounce rule, not to be confused with the ball bouncing twice and one side and thus ending the point.

### New Serving Rules

As mentioned earlier, some advanced players were spinning the ball while tossing in order to generate additional spin when they served. It was determined that this was too much of an advantage and rule changes were submitted in order to prevent this from happening. Starting in 2023, players must only use one hand to toss the ball and it cannot be visibly spun while tossing.

A drop serve has also been fully added to the rules in 2023. While the drop serve isn't typically utilized, it did have provisional status that will finally be removed. For some players, tossing the ball and hitting it out of the air can be a bit of a challenge. With the drop serve, a player can hold the ball around shoulder height and let it drop and bounce on the ground prior to completing the serve.

### Keeping Score While Serving

The first thing to know about keeping score in pickleball is that only the serving team can score points. This is different from tennis where the player who isn't serving can win points, games, sets, or even the match.

The serving team must serve diagonally to the player across from them and then let the returning shot bounce on their side before hitting the next shot. If the serving team wins the point, the server then switches sides with their teammate and serves to diagonally to the other side. If the serving team would have lost the point, their teammate would then serve from the same side they were standing on without switching. This continues until both teammates have lost a point while serving.

After both players on the serving team have lost their serve, it is then the returning team's turn to serve. The serve starts on the even side (right side when facing the net) for the player who was returning on that side prior to their turn to serve.

Here is a quick example of how to keep score while serving. 

The score is 0-0-1 and player 1 serves from the even side and hits an ace. The serving team then switches sides with eachother and would serve next player on the returning team. Before serving the server would call out the score as 1-0-1. Now lets pretend the server misses the serve altogether. The serving team would not switch sides, and player 2 on the serving team would then serve. They would call out a score of 1-0-2 and then serve diagonally to the player across from them.

Now let's assume the serving team misses the serve again and it is the returning teams turn to serve. The player currently on the even side who was returning from there during the other teams turn to serve would call out a score of 0-1-1 and then serve. This process repeats until one team reaches 11 points, win by 2.

## Line Call Rules

Players on the pickleball court are responsible for making line calls and determining if the ball was in or out. The player standing on the even side while serving or returning is responsible for calling the lines on their side, and the same for the player standing on the odd side. If the players switch sides during the point, the person closest to the ball when it lands is responsible for making the line call. 

Line calls can be a touchy subject on the court, especially if you're playing in a tournament or with very competitive players. It's important to make sure that you don't call a ball out if you're not 100% sure it landed out. Just like you might be watching a group of people playing and get surprised when one of them makes a bad call, chances are you've made a bad call once or twice. Prompt line calls are also something to be considered. Waiting too long to make a call in or out casts doubt in your call and should called in. If you ask the opponent their opinion on a line call that your team should have made, you give up your right to call the ball in or out.
